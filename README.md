# Todo App

This is a simple todo app created as part of Udacity's Full Stack Developer 
Nanodegree. My code deviates from the suggested implementation in places. For example, I use global event listeners that respond to the class attributes of 
elements rather than creating individual listeners with loops.

## To do (haha)

* Add collections of todo items
* CSS styling
